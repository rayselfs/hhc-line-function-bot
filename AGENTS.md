# AGENTS.md

## Startup Context

- This repo is `hhc-line-function-bot`, a TypeScript/Fastify LINE webhook service.
- The bot is a restricted church helper, not an open-ended chat bot.
- It should feel smart inside explicitly enabled functions, but deny or clarify requests outside those functions.
- Runtime behavior is controlled by bot profiles, function toggles, access control, and state stores.
- LLM routing defaults to Ollama, with optional `deepseek` support through `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
- Group follow-up context is requester-scoped and short-lived; never feed raw whole-group chat into the model.
- Slow tasks may be stored as long-running jobs and returned through a LINE postback button; do not use LINE push quota for those results.
- Public `/healthz` is minimal liveness. Public `/readyz` checks only Postgres and Redis.
- Detailed dependency status belongs in admin-only direct-chat `/diag`, not public endpoints.
- Keep public repo safety in mind: never commit real `.env` files, tokens, IDs, or secrets.

Read these first when starting work:

1. `README.md` for product behavior, configuration, commands, and deployment context.
2. `docs/architecture-context.md` for the request flow, subsystem map, and debug entry points.
3. `src/server.ts` for LINE entrance behavior, admin commands, access checks, and postback routing.
4. `src/router.ts`, `src/keyword-router.ts`, and `src/function-arguments.ts` for LLM/keyword routing and argument handling.
5. `src/functions/definitions.ts`, `src/functions/registry.ts`, and `src/functions/modules.ts` for function registration.
6. `src/access/*` for managed user/group/admin registration and PostgreSQL/in-memory stores.
7. `src/state/*`, `src/cache/*`, and `src/redis.ts` for session/cache persistence.
8. `src/__tests__/*` before changing behavior; tests are the best executable map of expected bot behavior.

## Current Product Shape

- One service can host multiple LINE bot profiles on canonical webhook paths, for example `/api/line/webhook/helper`.
- Profile names must be lowercase URL-safe names, and `webhookPath` must equal `/api/line/webhook/{profileName}`. Do not reintroduce `/line/{profile}/webhook`.
- Each profile has its own LINE credential references, access policy, wake-word behavior, enabled functions, and bootstrap `adminUserId`.
- The intended split is:
  - `helper`: managed direct users, managed groups, registration enabled.
  - future `main`: public direct users, groups blocked, registration disabled.
- Access registration is profile-scoped. Do not make user/group registration global unless the user explicitly asks.
- `adminUserId` is the single bootstrap superadmin. Legacy `adminUserIds`, `allowedUserIds`, and `allowedGroupIds` should not be reintroduced.
- Production profile source is `config/profiles.json`, loaded from `PROFILE_CONFIG_PATH=/app/config/profiles.json`. It must use `channelSecretEnv`, `channelAccessTokenEnv`, and `adminUserIdEnv`; do not put real LINE credentials or bootstrap user IDs in the file.
- The LINE bot must not expose provider OAuth callback routes. Do not add `/api/line/llm-auth/*`; use API keys from ACA/local secrets for remote providers.
- Remote API providers such as `deepseek` are profile-scoped; future `main` official profiles should define their own provider allowlist.
- Small-talk prompt behavior is profile config, not code personality. Production LLM profiles require `smallTalk.prompting.personaPrompt`, `conversationRulesPrompt`, `safetyRulesPrompt`, and `formatRulesPrompt`; do not add helper persona/safety fallback prompts in code. Keep house-church quote/golden-sentence behavior out of small talk; it should become a separate function if needed.

## Function Surface

The first-class functions are:

- `find_ppt_slides`: search configured `.pptx`, `.ppt`, `.key`, or `.odp` presentation files and return temporary sharing links.
- `query_schedule`: query configured service schedule sources and return a focused service list without exposing the source.
- `find_sheet_music`: search the catalog-backed pop and hymn sheet-music sources and return temporary sharing links. `find_pop_sheet_music` is only a thin internal legacy alias.
- `find_resource`: search authorized general church catalog sources without competing with explicit schedule, slide, or sheet-music intent.
- `query_wikipedia`: query Wikipedia for supported factual lookups.
- `save_schedule`: preview and manage profile-shared structured service schedules with one-year retention.
- `save_resource`: controlled LINE image/file attachment intake with purpose, validation, ClamAV scanning, confirmation, OneDrive publication, catalog upsert, and audit. It is enabled on `helper`, but write-function policy keeps it admin/explicit-grant only.
- Generic `save_memory` and `retrieve_memory` modules are not enabled on the helper production profile.
- Intro/help behavior is not a normal function execution path; keep it friendly and do not expose implementation details such as OneDrive or Notion to ordinary users.
- User functions, admin actions, and system actions are separate action kinds. Do not add management behavior to `enabledFunctions`.
- Admin natural language is direct-chat only. It may route to selected admin actions, currently invite-code creation, after admin identity and source policy checks.
- Admin actions must go through the action catalog, policy gate, admin action registry, audit, and sanitized route observability.
- Destructive admin actions must use `/confirm <code>`. `security_change` actions such as invite-code creation remain admin direct-only and audited unless explicitly reclassified.

When adding or changing a function:

- Add or update the function definition.
- Include capability metadata: `displayName`, `shortDescription`, `examples`, `requires`, `scope`, `sideEffectLevel`, `allowedSources`, `requiredSlots`, `resourcePolicy`, `memoryPolicy`, and `clarificationPrompt`.
- For a required value that users can omit by naming only the capability, declare `genericRequest.phrases` on that required slot (and `clearArguments` for related model-inferred fields). Do not add function-specific generic-request checks in routers or handlers.
- Register the function module.
- Update routing and argument extraction.
- Add clarification behavior for missing required slots.
- Add postback/numeric selection behavior if multiple results are possible.
- Add tests for enabled, disabled, unclear, deny, missing-slot, and multi-result cases.
- Update README and this file if the behavior changes how agents should work.

When adding or changing an admin action:

- Add the action name and metadata to the action catalog.
- Add or update policy tests for auth, source policy, side effect, and confirmation behavior.
- Register the handler in the admin action registry instead of adding execution logic to `server.ts`.
- Add admin router/eval cases and run `pnpm eval:admin`.
- Add observability tests that verify `/last-routes` does not expose raw messages or secrets.
- Keep telemetry, last routes, and last errors sanitized by construction.

## Access And Admin Model

- Ordinary users should use natural language, `/registry <code>`, `/help`, or `/whoami`.
- Slash admin commands are gated by `adminUserId` or DB-managed admin principals.
- Natural-language admin actions are gated the same way and must not run in groups.
- `adminDirectOnly` means admin commands should only run from direct chat except explicitly group-scoped commands.
- Registration is invite-code based:
  - Admins create one-time codes with `/invite-code-create`.
  - Admins may also create one-time codes through direct-chat natural language.
  - The reply must include a standalone `/registry <code>` line for copy/paste.
  - A direct user or group sends `/registry <code>` and is opened immediately.
  - Display names come from the LINE SDK, not typed command arguments.
  - Do not reintroduce pending approval commands or admin group self-registration.
- Use `/help` for public command/function help.
- Use `/help admin` for common grouped admin commands and `/help admin all` for advanced diagnostics.
- Prefer consistent names such as `/user-remove`, `/group-remove`, `/access-list`, and `/invite-code-create`.
- Do not bring back old `allow-*`, `/remove-group`, `/help-admin`, `/admin-help`, `/commands`, `/register`, `/access-requests`, `/access-approve`, `/access-deny`, `/invite-code-list`, `/invite-code-disable`, or `/register-this-group` commands unless the user explicitly reverses this decision.

## Function Scoping

- `profile.enabledFunctions` means profile-global functions for that profile only, not service-global functions.
- Direct users receive profile-global read functions plus DB-managed `profileName/userId/functionName` grants.
- Groups receive profile-global read functions plus DB-managed `profileName/groupId/functionName` grants and `profileName/userId/functionName` grants for the requester.
- User and group grants are additive. To make a function group-only, remove it from `enabledFunctions` and grant it to selected groups with `/function-grant`.
- Write functions such as explicit memory saves are admin-only by default even when present in `profile.enabledFunctions`; grant them to selected users with `/function-user-grant` or to selected groups with `/function-grant`.
- Use `/function-grant <functionName> [groupId]`, `/function-revoke <functionName> [groupId]`, and `/function-scopes [groupId]` for group function scope management.
- Use `/function-user-grant <functionName> <userId>`, `/function-user-revoke <functionName> <userId>`, and `/function-user-scopes <userId>` for user function scope management.
- In a group, admins can omit `groupId` for those function-scope commands. In direct chat, admins must provide `groupId`.

## Function Module Contract

- Every `FUNCTION_NAMES` entry must have a matching `FUNCTION_MODULES` module and function definition.
- Each module owns its router eval cases. Include positive, missing-slot, typo, negative, disabled, and cross-function cases.
- Use `expected: { type: "execute", ... }` or `expected: { type: "deny", ... }` so evals can check both allowed and blocked behavior.
- Keep `pnpm eval:router` deterministic and offline. Use `pnpm eval:router:ollama` only for manual live-model checks.

## State And Persistence

- In-memory stores are acceptable for single-replica local/dev behavior.
- `REDIS_URL` moves sessions, cache, recent errors, rate-limit state, and registration invite codes to Redis.
- `REDIS_URL` also moves destructive-action confirmation codes to Redis.
- `REDIS_URL` also moves requester-scoped conversation windows and long-running job results to Redis.
- Redis rate limiting must use atomic counters, not read-modify-write JSON buckets.
- PostgreSQL backs managed access principals and audit events when registration is enabled.
- PostgreSQL backs agent memory when configured. The app creates access and agent memory tables on startup.
- PostgreSQL must not store remote provider API keys, access tokens, or refresh tokens. Use it only for policy, registry, audit, and memory/catalog metadata.
- Remote provider API keys belong in ACA secrets or local `.env`, never in PostgreSQL or committed files.
- Agent memory must not store temporary sharing links. Store Graph drive/item metadata and regenerate short-lived links on demand.
- Successful PPT and sheet-music lookup metadata is a controlled `read`-function exception: it may store short-lived, scope-local resource metadata for recall, but it is not user-authored saved content and must not store raw files or generated sharing links.
- External resource memories may store user-provided URLs, but only when the user explicitly asks the bot to remember/save/store that resource.
- Recent resource recall is requester-scoped. Resource aliases and explicit text memories are scoped to the current profile and LINE source.
- Structured schedules are profile-shared, not requester/source-scoped. The same helper schedule can be queried from managed direct chats and groups.
- Structured schedule replacement and entry add/update/delete require preview and confirmation. The same schedule type and month has one active canonical record.
- Do not add automatic group-chat recording. Text memory must be explicit user intent.
- LINE attachment download/storage is allowed only through the controlled `save_resource` pending-attachment flow. If a profile explicitly allows `image` or `file` and the requester has effective `save_resource`, the webhook may store a short-lived requester/source-scoped pending attachment session and ask for purpose. The later text handler may download only after a supported purpose, must check target source write capability, size, MIME/magic bytes, extension, safe filename, hash, and virus scan, must fail closed when scanning is unavailable or not clean, and must require explicit confirmation before uploading to OneDrive and upserting catalog metadata. Do not add another binary publish path.
- Agent turn traces are diagnostic metadata only. Do not store raw user text, file names, invite codes, secrets, or generated sharing links in traces.
- Do not assume multi-replica safety without Redis for sessions/cache/invite codes.
- Group and room clarification/selection sessions are requester-scoped. They require the same `source.userId` to continue, and should not be created or matched when LINE does not provide a requester user id.
- Long-running job result retrieval follows the same requester/source rule. A group user must not be able to fetch another user's job result.
- Soft display-name personalization is for task-state replies such as "what title?" or "please choose"; avoid adding names to final data-heavy function results unless the user asks.
- SearXNG is only a sheet-music not-found fallback after requester consent. It must not become a general web browsing function, must not fetch result pages or download files, and must not save results automatically.

## Workflow

- Use `pnpm` for package scripts.
- Prefer small, targeted changes that follow the existing module boundaries.
- Before pushing behavior changes, run:
  - `pnpm format:check`
  - `pnpm typecheck`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
- For router behavior changes, also run `pnpm eval:router` when relevant.
- For live Ollama model validation, run `pnpm eval:router:ollama` manually; do not add it to CI.
- For admin natural-language routing changes, also run `pnpm eval:admin`.
- For webhook entrance changes, consider `pnpm smoke:webhook` against a local dev server or deployed URL.
- Update tests when changing routing, LINE webhook entrance behavior, access control, admin commands, or function execution behavior.
- Keep `README.md` aligned when changing user-facing or admin-facing commands.

Testing map:

- Entrance/access/admin behavior: `src/__tests__/entrance.test.ts`.
- Router and fallback behavior: `src/__tests__/router.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/router-evals.test.ts`, and fixtures.
- Function implementations: `src/__tests__/functions.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/sheet-music.test.ts`, and Graph/Notion-related tests.
- Store behavior: `src/__tests__/access-store.test.ts`, `src/__tests__/stores.test.ts`.
- Config validation: `src/__tests__/config.test.ts`.

## Deployment Rule

- Important: pushing app/build/deploy path changes to `main` triggers the Azure DevOps pipeline and deploys the app.
- Treat `git push origin main` as a production deployment action when changed paths match `azure-pipelines.yml` trigger filters.
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/**`-only changes should not trigger the pipeline.
- Do not push deploy-triggering changes to `main` unless the user explicitly asks to deploy or confirms that deploying is acceptable.
- If the user asks for code changes but not deployment, commit locally or leave changes staged/unstaged as appropriate, then ask before pushing.

## Deployment Context

- CI/CD is defined in `azure-pipelines.yml`.
- Images are built for `alive.azurecr.io`.
- Runtime configuration and secrets belong in Azure Container Apps/Azure secrets, not in the repository.
