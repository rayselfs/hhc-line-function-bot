# Production Operations Runbook

## Health And Readiness

- `GET /healthz` is liveness only. It returns minimal service status and must not expose profiles, functions, or provider details.
- `GET /readyz` is public readiness for the data layer only. It checks Postgres and Redis, and must not mention Ollama, Graph, Notion, profile names, enabled functions, IDs, or secrets.
- Use LINE admin `/diag` in direct chat for detailed dependency diagnostics.

## Admin Diagnostics

Direct-message admin commands:

```text
/diag
/llm-status
/last-routes
/last-errors
/help
/help admin
/help admin all
```

`/diag` may show dependency status for Ollama, Redis, Postgres, Graph, and Notion, but must not print tenant IDs, database IDs, folder IDs, LINE IDs, tokens, secrets, credential URLs, raw user messages, or invite codes.

## Registration And Admin Safety

- The bootstrap `adminUserId` is the single superadmin for each profile.
- Admins create one-time registration codes with `/invite-code-create`.
- The reply includes a copyable standalone `/registry <code>` line.
- Destructive admin actions must require `/confirm <code>`.
- `security_change` actions, such as invite-code creation, remain admin direct-only and audited, but do not require confirmation unless their action metadata changes.

## Local Webhook Smoke Test

Use the smoke tool to sign a LINE-shaped webhook payload:

```powershell
pnpm smoke:webhook -- --url http://localhost:3000/api/line/webhook/helper --secret PLACEHOLDER_LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET --text "小哈"
```

The tool prints status, request id when present, and response body. It must not print the channel secret or access token.

## Dependency Checks

- Redis: verify the ACA secret `REDIS_URL` is set and `/readyz` shows Redis `ok`.
- Postgres: verify `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_SSL` are set and `/readyz` shows Postgres `ok`.
- Ollama: use `/llm-status` or `/diag`, not `/readyz`.
- Graph: use function smoke tests through LINE, then `/diag` for configured/not configured state.
- Notion: use `pnpm check:notion` locally or function smoke tests through LINE, then `/diag` for configured/not configured state.

## Rollback

Use Azure CLI to point the Container App back to a previous known-good image:

```powershell
az containerapp update `
  --name PLACEHOLDER_CONTAINER_APP_NAME `
  --resource-group PLACEHOLDER_RESOURCE_GROUP `
  --image alive.azurecr.io/alive/hhc-line-function-bot:PLACEHOLDER_TAG
```

After rollback, verify:

```text
GET /healthz
GET /readyz
```

Then send `/diag` from a direct admin LINE chat.

## Do Not Paste

Do not paste these into LINE, logs, commits, screenshots, or public issues:

- LINE channel secret or access token.
- Invite codes that have not expired.
- `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` if it reveals private network layout.
- Graph tenant/client/folder/drive IDs.
- Notion token or database ID.
- Raw user messages from production.
